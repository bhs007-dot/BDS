## Overview
BDSv1 is a Python-based security monitoring tool designed for blue team operations, penetration testing, and anomaly detection. It integrates AI-based anomaly detection, heuristic analysis, process monitoring, behavior tracking, and web threat detection using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) mode. The tool leverages libraries like tshark (from Wireshark) and Suricata for real-time threat detection.

This script was developed to assist in identifying potential compromises, such as port scans, brute force attacks, suspicious processes, and web-based threats, while reducing alert noise through deduplication and behavior summarization.

## Features
- **Hybrid Detection:** Combines AI (Isolation Forest), heuristics, and rule-based monitoring.
- **Alert Types:** Supports detection for heuristic compromises, AI anomalies, port scans, brute force attempts, suspicious processes, and WAF threats.
- **Behavior Tracking:** Tracks and summarizes attacker behavior per IP or process to provide context in alerts.
- **WAF Monitoring Mode:** Focuses on web threats (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) with automatic rule downloads.
- **Real-time and Batch Alerting:** Options for immediate or interval-based alert outputs.
- **Automatic Rule Updates:** Downloads and extracts Suricata rules, including WAF-specific rules.
- **User Interface:** Interactive menu for selecting monitoring modes and interfaces.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.6+:** Ensure Python is installed.
- **Packages:** Automatically installs required packages (`psutil`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `requests`) if missing.
- **Wireshark:** Installed with tshark executable (path: `C:\Program Files\Wireshark\tshark.exe` by default).
- **Suricata:** IDS/IPS tool for advanced rule-based detection (path: `C:\Program Files\Suricata\bin\suricata.exe` by default). Download from [Suricata IDS Website](https://suricata-ids.org/download/).
- **Dependencies:** Ensure Suricata and Wireshark are configured correctly. Update paths in the script if installed elsewhere.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository containing `blue_team.py`.
2. Install Python dependencies by running the script; it will auto-install missing packages.
3. Install Wireshark and ensure tshark is accessible.
4. Install Suricata:
   - Download from [https://suricata-ids.org/download/](https://suricata-ids.org/download/) or use Chocolatey (`choco install suricata`).
   - Verify installation by running `suricata -h` in the command prompt.
5. Update script paths if necessary:
   - `TSHARK_PATH`, `SURICATA_PATH`, `SURICATA_CONFIG`, and `SURICATA_LOG_DIR` are defined at the top of `blue_team.py`. Adjust them based on your system.

## Usage
1. Run the script with Python: `python blue_team.py`.
2. The script will:
   - Prompt for traffic capture to train the AI model.
   - Download and update Suricata rules.
   - Start Suricata in the background.
   - Present a monitoring menu.
3. Select from the menu:
   - **Option 1:** Real-time alerts for general monitoring.
   - **Option 2:** Batch alerts with custom intervals.
   - **Option 3:** WAF monitoring for web threats.
   - **Option 4:** Exit.
4. During monitoring, the script will detect and alert on threats, including behavior summaries.

## Troubleshooting
- **Suricata Not Found:** If you see a "FileNotFoundError", ensure Suricata is installed and update `SURICATA_PATH` in the script. Common path is `C:\Program Files\Suricata\bin\suricata.exe`.
- **tshark Not Found:** Install Wireshark and ensure it's in your PATH or update `TSHARK_PATH`.
- **No Alerts:** Verify network interfaces are correctly selected and traffic is flowing. Enable verbose mode for debugging.
- **WAF Rules Download Fails:** Check the `WAF_RULES_URL` in the script and ensure it's valid. Use alternative rule sources if needed.
